Hi! I'm Sadie Manicom and this is setup to be my portfolio website. Here I'm going to be showcasing the projects and tools that I work on.

My personal goals are to combine my tech development skills with creativity and artistic touches. I studied Computer Science at Arizona State University and I also have a passion for practicing art and music on my own, so I am working to utilize my skillset to create products and tools that can be functional and efficient as well as charming and original.

My top priority at this time is to complete the tech portfolio page to showcase the demos of things I've actually developed along with a few details about tools, frameworks, or just general points of interest on the technical side of things. Once I have this my next goal for the site will be to create a separate page to also show the more creative endeavors - my art, music, sound design, etc. which I may also use for further customization and flair.
